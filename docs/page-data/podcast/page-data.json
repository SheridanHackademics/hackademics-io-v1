He started attending hackathons in January 2019 when he was in his 3rd year of college. He has since participated in over nine hackathons and has been placed twice.

We know what you’re thinking—philosophy to a creative field, how does that work? Alex can assure you that it’s not as far-fetched as you may think. Obviously philosophy taught her a lot about critical thinking, but she believes it taught her a lot more. While studying, Alex was able to build the desire to become a practical-doer; she felt that her creative side was always present, and philosophy helped compel her toward design.

When he attended the mighty Hack The North at UW, his technological perspective changed forever. In the 3 years since, Omar has been fortunate to attend each Hack The North, and has not looked back since.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Omar was first motivated to attend alongside his friends, and was actually influenced by one to apply. Above all however, Omar wished to learn; he wasn’t focused on winning at first and desired meeting and talking to as many people in diverse backgrounds as possible, and this helped him greatly.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Omar maintains that when you begin talking to people, you’ll realize the community is not that intimidating as they will continue to attend the same events and become more recognizable; you can engrain yourself in the community and make yourself a known face by continuing to attend, too! Something else he highlights is gaining career advice by talking to career professionals as it was the gateway to his first major opportunity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Omar can’t stress attending these events enough, and he goes more in depth into why as well as his own individual experiences regarding this throughout the podcast. Additionally, Omar goes into other interests and how it’s encouraged to have/talk about your other interests at these events, rather than solely gearing yourself towards tech.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To hear about this and many other awesome things regarding Hackathons, job/internship opportunities, networking, mentorships, and so much more, listen today!</strong></p>\n"}}]},"pagesJson":{"title":"About us","description":"Learn more about Hackademics and our events."}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1903412954","3000541721","478340843"]}
