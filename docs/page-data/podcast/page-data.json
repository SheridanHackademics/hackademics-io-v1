Weâ€™re excited to be back with Amanda, who is a 4th year life science student at York University. Her nature is actually not rooted within tech and hack-culture, however she was passionate in learning about tech-related things and maintains that everyone can/should afford to do the same.\n0:07 - Intro\n0:57 - Amanda introduces herself\n1:57 - How did you decide to get into Hackathons?\n2:32 - About a science club that Amanda was involved in\n3:23 - What was your first experience with hacking culture?\n4:37 - What was the passion that drove you toward this route?\n5:32 - About Elle Hacks\n7:11 - Why Amanda has never participated in a hackathon\n7:46 - If you aren't tech based, what did you help with?\n8:56 - About the most recent Elle Hacks 10:24 - What's something special about Elle hacks?\n11:25 - Previous Elle Hacks prizes\n12:10 - What did you help with in organizing Elle Hacks?\n13:58 - About the upcoming Elle Hacks\n14:59 - If you were to create your own hackathon, what is a key you would focus on?\n17:22 - Do you expect hackathons to expand out to different fields?\n19:33 - More about other fields\n20:35 - Falling asleep at hackathons\n21:35 - Where you can find Amanda\nAmanda on LinkedIn\nApply to Elle Hacks\nÂ Amanda got her start in hack-a-thons by helping to organize oneâ€”Elle Hacksâ€”that is focused on the spotlight/inclusion of women within science, and she says itâ€™s the best thing that came into her life. Amanda tells an interesting story how she expected the event to be formal and serious, but quickly found out that the attendees were actually very comfortable in their environment and dressed/looked as they pleased; it goes to show that the passion for these events exceeds any competition and everyone is there to bond and learn. Something else Amanda discusses is how these hack-a-thons focus on real-world/important problems; itâ€™s a skill that teaches all participants how to bridge this thinking within technology, which is something that is major in modern society. Through all this, Amanda talks about the position of viewing herself as infectiously positive and how hack-a-thons helped sharpen this side of her along with other social skills.\nFurther into the pod, Amanda dives into other aspects of her background and stories organizing Elle Hacks, and how much she wishes she was a participant each time she is in that position! Lastly, Amanda discusses some of her favourite project ideas and what one should think about when tackling a design prompt/challenge, which is very useful inspiration for existing/aspiring Hackers!\nOverall, we were very excited to speak with Amanda and hear all of the above information as well as way more, so make sure you check this one out.","content":"<p><strong>Greetings everyone!

When asked about her entrance into NUVO, she explained how a school project paved the way for the company. As a semester-long project, Zubash and her team pitched their idea of starting a Hackathon to NUVO. The company was impressed and hired her as a part of the organizing team to launch their first Hackathon, Hack the NU. The research methods and design thinking skills she gathered from the school courses helped her excel in the company. She shared her experience of planning and organizing the hackathon while juggling portfolio work and school projects simultaneously. Zubash shared with us how collaboration and delegation helped her manage all the tasks as smoothly as possible. Virtual hackathons come with their own set of pros and cons. She explains in detail about her new experience of organizing and coming up with a project plan for this yearâ€™s online event.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>She considered the hackathon experience from networking to learning new skills as winning more than actually winning the 1st place. Zubash stresses the importance of young people participating in hackathons and on why it helps for both the participants and the company at the same time. Along with this, she also shared some tips and tricks on working behind the scenes in a hackathon and gave some advice that all of us can benefit from.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To hear about this and many other awesome things regarding hackathons, jobs/internship opportunities, networking, mentorship, and so much more, listen today!</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n"}},{"enclosure":{"length":"40219715","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://anchor.fm/s/35f891cc/podcast/play/21845470/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2020-9-30%2Fe6d31950-023d-9911-19bc-e3162373f9c4.mp3"},"isoDate":"2020-10-30T12:00:00.000Z","link":"https://anchor.fm/hackademics/episodes/Alex-Thompson-about-philosophy--design-and-life-changing-experiences-elp60u","pubDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 12:00:00 GMT","title":"Alex Thompson about philosophy, design and life changing experiences ","guid":"c1fead5e-3332-4f3d-8ff3-0f179c7e90b0","dc":{"creator":"Hackademics"},"creator":"Hackademics","contentSnippet":"Welcome back yâ€™all, you're not going to want to miss this one!

When he attended the mighty Hack The North at UW, his technological perspective changed forever. In the 3 years since, Omar has been fortunate to attend each Hack The North, and has not looked back since.\nOmar was first motivated to attend alongside his friends, and was actually influenced by one to apply. Above all however, Omar wished to learn; he wasnâ€™t focused on winning at first and desired meeting and talking to as many people in diverse backgrounds as possible, and this helped him greatly.Â \nOmar maintains that when you begin talking to people, youâ€™ll realize the community is not that intimidating as they will continue to attend the same events and become more recognizable; you can engrain yourself in the community and make yourself a known face by continuing to attend, too! Something else he highlights is gaining career advice by talking to career professionals as it was the gateway to his first major opportunity.\nOmar canâ€™t stress attending these events enough, and he goes more in depth into why as well as his own individual experiences regarding this throughout the podcast.
