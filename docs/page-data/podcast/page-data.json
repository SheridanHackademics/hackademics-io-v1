He started attending hackathons in January 2019 when he was in his 3rd year of college. He has since participated in over nine hackathons and has been placed twice.

When he attended the mighty Hack The North at UW, his technological perspective changed forever. In the 3 years since, Omar has been fortunate to attend each Hack The North, and has not looked back since.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Omar was first motivated to attend alongside his friends, and was actually influenced by one to apply. Above all however, Omar wished to learn; he wasnât focused on winning at first and desired meeting and talking to as many people in diverse backgrounds as possible, and this helped him greatly.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Omar maintains that when you begin talking to people, youâll realize the community is not that intimidating as they will continue to attend the same events and become more recognizable; you can engrain yourself in the community and make yourself a known face by continuing to attend, too!
